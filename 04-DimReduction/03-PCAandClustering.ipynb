    "# Tutorial Objectives\n",
    "**Dimensionality reduction** is an incredibly useful tool in data science as well as neuroscience. Here, we'll explore one main method of dimensionality reduction: **Principal Components Analysis**. We'll first perform PCA step-by-step on a simulated dataset, and then learn the very simple commands to do this in Python. Next, we'll use *k*-means clustering to find clusters in the two-dimensional PCA data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we'll learn to apply PCA for dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Perform PCA on a simulated neuroscience datasets\n",
    "- Calculate the variance explained\n",
    "- Use *k*-means clustering to find clusters in your data\n",
    "- Plot the results of your dimensionality reduction and clustering, coloring each point by either a known feature or by a cluster assignment"
