    "\n",
    "Yesterday, we asked you to write your own functions for implementing cross-validation. In practice, this won't be necessary, because `scikit-learn` offers a number of [helpful functions](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/model_selection.html) that will do this for you. For example, you can cross-validate a classifer using `cross_val_score`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`cross_val_score` takes a `sklearn` model like `LogisticRegression`, as well as your `X` and `y` data. It then retrains your model on test/train splits of `X` and `y`, and returns the test accuracy on each of the test sets."
